Getting Started
  - we live in a day and age when information filtering is absolutely essential. The good side of the filter
  is when it removes things off topic and not relevant. The bad side of the filter is when it prematurely
  overlooks something that is helpful. 
  - what is relevant will not be the same for everyone and is very much dependent on your experience level and
  foundation. 
  - it is really hard to know what you need to know on the first pass.
  - if you decide not to learn a term, make a note of why you choose to skip it and where it was found. You can
  always circle back and add it in if it was a mistake.

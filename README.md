Opinionated views on education and practical directives to close the gaps

Starting Points / Assumptions / Opinions
  - traditional education is criticized for being expensive, behind-the-times, and not equipping students for
  the real world
  - informal education is criticized for not being systematic or complete
  
Personally
  - I have been frustrated learning in both kingdoms.
    -- The Wild provides an allure of up-to-date information, but technology moves to quickly that a book last 
    year can already be out of date today. There are constantly new and better ways to do things which is exactly
    what is required for the real-world. Truth be told, it is really hard to teach.
    -- The foundation provided by Universities is part of the picture, but not the whole. The best that they have
    to offer can be extracted and opened up.
    
Approach
  - Developed an abstracted approach to learning new technologies and frameworks. This will be a meta-educational
  approach that systematically teaches the required skills for surviving in the Wild.
  - Consolidate approaches to go from very beginner to expert programmer. Instead of creating one path, each
  phase or component will be thoroughly refined over time, informed by community members, so that they can stand
  alone. Then, various paths will be created to navigate through these phases and/or components based on feedback
  from the community and popularity.
  - Community members can create their own paths, follow someone else's, diverge as needed, and submit what has
  worked for them.
  - Provide a self-evident learning process that builds on itself to teach and master the learning system.

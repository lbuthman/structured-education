1. PluralSight
  -- trial started 7-18-17
  -- very boring videos, dull voice over inane PowerPoint presentations
  -- like assessment quiz
  -- have not seen any projects
  -- <todo>take quiz for course after completing</todo>
  -- locks you in to a full year membership, pricing sits at $25 per month
  -- the information might be pretty good, even though the presentation is poor
  -- excellent and diverse course offerings covering just about everything I am interested in and more
  
2. Treehouse
  -- not a log of courses for Java ecosystem
  -- lots of content related to PHP and WordPress, might be a better training program for that someday
  -- also lots for mobile dev, definitely something I am interested in for the future
  -- I believe they have exercises and little tests which would be nice

3. Lynda
  -- pretty much has everything with a range of video engagement quality
  -- I haven't seen any exercises or projects or anything of the sort
  -- free for me and many who have library cards
  
4. Codeacademy
  -- purports to have quizs, projects, and learning advisors!
  -- not sure what the personalized learning plan is but I like the sound of it
  -- $20/month, good price and 14 day cancellation period
  -- super light course load, seems to follow quality over quantity approach
  
5. SkillShare
  -- not too excited about the course catalog, but still need to search premium content during 30-day trial
  -- looks like the poor man's lynda.com
  
6. Egghead
  -- benefits of pro membership are really odd and vague
  -- geared toward JS and that ecosystem, will be good to revist when ready

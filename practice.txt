Getting Started

- You don't always know the value of practice problems. For me, they can be easy to skip, especially when
I discount them, question their value, or believe I already have it figured out. The problem with this is
that the distance from conceptual to practical is very difficult to estimate correctly. Something seemingly
simple can have all kinds of things embedded in it that take a long time to untangle and straighten out.

- Therefore, just do it when it comes to practice problems. After completed, rate the difficulty and decide
if the practice problem should become an exercise (something to repeat a few times).

- If there is a time constraint, make note why you must skip a problem. If you get stuck in the future, go 
back to what you skipped because there might be some value there.

Creating Practice Problems - TODO!

- You won't always be fortunate to have practice problems laid in your lap and creating them can be difficult.

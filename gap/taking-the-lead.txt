- I like to joke about the vitures of being a "bad student". In the context of many formal education worlds,
being a good students means precisely inputting the output of the teacher and assigned material, committing
them to memory, and being able to output them for an assignment or test. Being a good student in this context
means doing exactly what the teacher said.

- The problem with an overly dogged student like this is that they are not taking an active part in their
education. To throw some things out, question relevancy, or do things one's one way gets cast as being a bad
student.

- However, in the real world, the ability to take the lead in your education, find sources, sort through 
and filter vast amounts of information, all leads to an enjoyable, fulfilling and rich educational experience.
The learning is deeper, more personal and the application can be immediate.

- So in this way, I would argue that being a bad student is a good thing. This statement is meant to address
a gap that may or may not exist in your educational system. Not all institutions or educators take such narrow
views, but some do.

- In A capella music, four singers singing in harmony can produce a fifth tone. I don't know the details, but
it has to do with harmonics in frequencies.

- I know for myself, there are all kinds of other benefits and traits that magically appear as I learn and refine
my approach to learning. These additive benefits seems like they would be difficult to instill on their own but
are provided for free as I develop. What I have seen so far, specifically, is breadth of mind and noticing when I am
not calm and being able to take a step back. I am less apt to overstate my skills, having more self awareness and
confidence. I think the confidence comes from seeing that there are things I can be good at while still seeing
my limitations and where I lack.

- I am interested if the community experiences similar "fifth-harmonies", what they are and how they manifest.

  - Conceptual vs. Practical 
    -> Conceptual pushes forward, exposure to ideas and approaches not yet imagined
    -> Practical makes conceptual a reality, uncovering all the dirty details (good quote in agile-requirements
    I believe)
    -> only Conceptual results in no real skill, only Practical limits the field of vision

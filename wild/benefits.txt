- All of the technologies and frameworks out there arose because of some benefit they provided, or problem
they solved. Most books discussing these technologies and frameworks spend the preface, first chapter, or
each chapters intro on explaining this topic.

- I have found that sometimes I am not able to fully appreciate the benefit upfront. Because I didn't spend
time learning x I don't really understand the benefit of y.

- With this in mind, there must be some filtering during these sections. In addition, if you ever feel a little
lost, it can be good to revisit these sections.

- It would be cool to do a genealogy of technology that addresses the progression and extension of each
predecessor.

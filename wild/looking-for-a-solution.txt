When looking for a particular solution.

0. prepare a simple plaintext document to record your adventure
1. slow down and refine exactly what you want to know
2. read each item and select the first match
3. be prepared for stuff that goes over your head, new terms and other intimidating knowledge blasts
	— make a note of the foreign terms, technologies, etc.
	— be patient and fearless, the solution to your problem may be buried and require some unpacking. This is normal, 
  no reason to feel discouraged or that you aren’t ready (not smart enough, blah blah blah).
